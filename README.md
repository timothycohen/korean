# Tools to learn Korean 🇰🇷

Work in progress.

## Currently includes:

&nbsp;   🌈    **한글 ↔️ Color**

&nbsp;   #️⃣    **Numbers. Sino, Native, and more!**

### Plans:

- spaced repetition system with counters
- notes on each of the topics to accompany the tools
- whatever else strikes me as useful!
